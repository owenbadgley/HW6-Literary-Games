# HW6-Literary-Games

  I went into this week planning to go hard on godot, becasue thats the program I care a lot more about being better at. However, I thought it would be kind of fun to make a 
game where you make burgers and serve them to people in inky. I thought that this would be a not very difficult task, but the deeper I went into it the more I realized I needed
to know about ink to pull it off. It led to me learning about how to use variables, conditionals, and all kinds of wacky stuff that I didn't even know could be done in ink. It 
was actually pretty fun, definately the most I have enjoyed ink so far. I didn't make much of a compelling story, but I thought for the amount I knew about ink before going 
into it I ended up with something pretty cool. 
  The tradeoff to this is that my godot project ended up being some bunny rabbit doing a jump over a t rex. For the amount of time that I put into it, I honestly thought the 
godot script turned out pretty good. I think it's funny, at least. I don't exactly know whether it's ludological or not. I would say it most likely is, because theres not any 
narrative, it's all about coming up with a story in your head about what the hell is going on.
  In terms of the different types of sequences, I can see how they could all be used in a story. Just the normal sequence, for example, could be used for npc dialogue. Once you have talked
to them enough, they just start saying the same sentence over and over again. Thats just how they work. The cycle could be used for a way to cycle through different options, which I would say
makes sense based on the name. It could be something like selecting which song is playing in the background or something. Finally, the shuffle can be used to give a random description when 
interacting with something in the environment, a mirror for example. They all serve necessary narrative purposes.
